# Trip-Planner-App

Trip Planner is a Flutter-made app that is designed to help plan your vacations. This app uses the Open Street Maps tile server and Open Route Service API, which allows for direction-based navigation. Firebase backend services are working, which means that users can publish trip itineraries for others to see, using their Google account. I also integrated the MTA Subway API, where you can see real-time subway arrivals at stations nearest to you.

## Development

Want to beta-test this app? Follow this link to go to TestFlight on IOS: https://testflight.apple.com/join/f5PW402r

This repository is a lot of commits BEHIND. I will update it the next time I have the chance (I work on a seperate private repository to keep .gitignore files consistant).

## KNOWN BUGS:

- The navigation feature would often save previous users' starting location when routing multiple times, which creates multiple markers.

## To-Do list

- Beta Test App

- Add ChatGPT integration and better search-bar functionality

- Publish to the App Store
